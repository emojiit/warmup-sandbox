## FAQ

### what are we even using

Gin and postgresql on backend, vue + bulmacss on frontend. xamarin.forms or maui will be used for a mobile app.

### how do you set it up

Instructions are below, and are known to work best on linux (tested on Manjaro, Debian). It is possible to set up a working copy on Windows but it is slightly harder.

### what if i don't want to

Too bad. If only we had any kind of remote server where we could test or deploy onto?

### where is x?

Slow down, bucko. We don't even have a proper code design to shave...
